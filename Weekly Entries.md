# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1
**What have I learnt this week?**  Week 1 was an introductive week for everyone and mostly everyone was new to the contents of this subject. This week we were introduced to the different types of systems, their functions and their purpose.


**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?** Before Week 1, I had no proper definition of a system and the different types of systems. After the first workshop, I understood what systems are, the difference between the different types of systems and the function of each system.


**What insights have I gained?** The insights I have gained in Week 1 are: - What complicated and complex systems are - Introduction to the new term, Chaos systems - Characteristics of the three types of systems 


**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?** My strengths include understanding a concept when it is taught rather than leaving it till later to understand it, and the ability to research and gather useful information of the content of this subject. However, one of my weaknesses is that I leave things to the last minute but for the assignments, I will try my best to get it done as soon as possible.


**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** Since this was week 1, the teams were not formed yet. Therefore, every student doing this subject was working individually. Challenges that I encountered while studying were finding reliable and accurate information and working on GitHub (since I was completely new to it). One way I handled the first challenge was by researching and visiting multiple websites to check for overlapping information. Some websites produce inaccurate information. Therefore, the websites must be reputable websites and the information must be uploaded by well-known authors. To handle the second challenge, I watched GitHub tutorials on YouTube and the video on Canvas that gives us an introduction to GitHub and how to use it.


**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** My approach to next week's workshop would be making notes and noting down valuable information into my notebook. This way, it can help me remember things comfortably. I expect to come across some more abstruse content, but I am hoping to understand it well by noting down important points and asking questions if I don't understand something.


**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** Something that proved to be useful from this week was the difference between complicated and complex Systems. People often consider complicated and complex systems to be the same because complicated and complex are synonyms of each other. This includes me as well. I thought that complicated and complex systems are the same but now I have learnt that these two are different from each other.



## Week 2
**What have I learnt this week?** Week 2 was all about learning the different types of models. This week I learned how models can help us build and improve our understanding of complex systems. 


**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?** Before the Week 2 workshop I didn't know the different types of models and how they work. However, after Week 2 I found out, through the workshop, that different types of models will have different purposes and their process of operating. 


**What insights have I gained?** The insights I have gained after Week 2 are: -The different types of models - The functions of different models - Having an understanding of many models is preferred rather than an understanding of a single model. 


**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?** One strength that I have observed is that I am able to understand the various models at once. One weakness I have observed is that it takes too long for me to understand the concept of models. 


**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** The challenge I encountered in Week 2 was finishing all of my pre-work for all subjects because my laptop was facing some technical problems. The way I handled this was by using my mobile phone. Mobile phone are great portable tools that are very useful. I had the Canvas app downloaded on my phone and hence used my phone to complete the pre-work. 


**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** As I aproach Week 3, I would re-watch the Week 2 workshop to make sure that I haven't missed any important details which will be useful for Week 3. Next week, I expect to come across other models and their behaviours. 


**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** The theory of many-model thinking proved to be useful because it helped me to better understand the assessment task. I have learnt the importance of utilizing many models in a complex system rather than a single model. 



## Week 3
**What have I learnt this week?** This week I learnt the different types of models and in what situations that can be used. For example, the Rational model and the Signalling theory. 


**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?** Before this week's lesson, I did not know the difference between these models. But after the lesson, I now know how these different models work and what requirements they have. 


**What insights have I gained?** The insights I have gained after Week 3 are : -Functions of different models - In depth explanation of each relevant model


**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?** The strengths that I observed are ability to understand topics when it is taught and the ability to explain it to others about what I have learnt. A weakness of mine I obserbed were completing some set tasks on time due to poor time management.


**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** A challenge that I observed this week was making notes for the content covered in this week. To handle this challenge, I went through the slides and also did some research to enhance my understanding. 


**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?**  Next time, I would ask more questions about anything I do not understand and start taking notes from the start. I expect to come across some familiar concepts because I have done the pre-work for next week's concepts. 


**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** A theory that proved to be useful was the explanation of each model because it will help me with my group task. I have learnt what models that I will be using in my assessment.  



## Week 4
**What have I learnt this week?** This week we learnt how System Dynamics can be used to analyse systems with feedbacks and interdependencies by using models. 


**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  Before this week, I had no idea what System Dynamics is. In fact, I never heard of the term before. However, now I know the proper definition of System Dynamics and its functions. 


**What insights have I gained?** The insights I have gained are: -What System Dynamics consists of (sources, sinks, etc.) - How systems can use System Dynamics. 


**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?** My strength that I have observed is my ability to write down notes for the content that is covered each week. A weakness that I have observed this week was to completely understand the concept of System Dynamics. 


**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?**  A challenge that I encountered this week was to understand the concept of this week. To handle this challenge, I went through the slides to ensure that I did not miss any important points and also read through the information on Canvas. 


**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** Next time, I would prepare for the workshop by reading what content will be covered to ensure that I fully understand everything. Next week, we are expected to pre-read the information on Canvas about Week 5's workshop. 


**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** Something that proved to be useful this week was to understand how System dynamics work. This is because it can assist us in understanding how we can use models to solve a problem. I have learnt that we should always take the many-model thinkning approach because it reduces the room for errors and hence giving us accurate results. 



## Week 5
**What have I learnt this week?** This week's content was about learning how and why some real world phenomena are normally distributed. I also learnt how to analyse a normal distribution graph (Bell Curve).  


**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?** Before this week's lecture, I did not knwo how to apply the Bell Curve to real life examples. However, after the lecture I know how the Bell Curve works and how it can be applied to real life phenomena. 


**What insights have I gained?**  The insight I have gained this week is the different types of distributions. There were three types of distributions that we learnt of. These are Probability distribution, Normal distribution and Long-tailed distribution. We were taught how each of these distributions work.


**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?**  One of my strength that I observed was my ability to work in a team. After this week's lecture, our team organized a Zoom meeting in which we discussed how were are going to complete the assignment. One weakness that I observed was to understand which models can be used to solve a particular problem. Sometimes I struggle to understand a few models. To overcome this weakness, I perform excessive research to completely understandhe model. 


**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** A challenge that my team encountered was how to communicate with each other. It was difficult for us to communicate with each other and designate specific tasks to each member. To handle this challenge, we organized a group on social media where we can message each other and this made our life much easier. 


**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** To prepare for next week's lecture I will pre-read the information provided on Canvas so that I know what is going to be discussed in the lecture. 


**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** Something that I found to be useful was the different types of distributions. This is because it can assist us in understanding how real life phenomena can be explained using these distributions. I have learnt how we can apply these distrubutions o our understanding of how COVID-19 spreads and use it to control the virus. 



## Week 6
**What have I learnt this week?** This week I have learnt how complex systems evolve over time. For instance, how previous behaviour of a system affects the future behaviour of the same system (Path dependance). 


**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?** Something that I did not know before this week's lecture was the Markov process. I had no idea what this idea but after going through all the relevant information related to this process, I understand what this is. 


**What insights have I gained?** The insight I gained was how we can apply the Markov process to different situations/problems and ideate various solutions. 


**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?** One strength that I observed this week was working with my team to complete the set tasks and the assignment draft that is due. A weakness that I observed was that to understand all the concepts of this week's lecture. I did not understand a few concepts of this week's lecture and I had to perform more research to completely understand it. 


**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** A challenge that I observed this week was to organise our group meetings. When one or two members are free at a certain time, the other members are busy at the same time. To handle this, we decided that we will organise the meeting on a day and time when no one has any class. 


**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** For the preparation of next week's lecture, I will make sure that I ask the lecturer for any questions that I have in my mind. If I don't have any questions, then I will read about the content before the lecture. 


**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** A theory that proved to be useful was the Path Dependance model. This is because this model will be very useful for me to use it in my assignment. I have learnt how I can apply this model in real life problems to solve them. 



## Week 7
**What have I learnt this week?** This week I have learnt the concept of the Segregation and Peer Effects and how it can be used in different situations. 


**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?**  Before this week, I did not know the Coordination and Culture model and how it can affect certain decisions of someone. For example, some people store ketchup bottles in their cupboards while some keep it in their fridge. 


**What insights have I gained?**  The insight that I have gained is why different cultures have different rules and why some countries have a different set of rules. For example, why drivers in America drive on the right-hand side of the road whereas drivers in Australia drive on the left-hand side of the road. 


**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?** A strength that I have observed was the ability to understand a specific concept when it is taught. This is because I constantly take notes of important concepts. A weakness that I observeed was the inability to apply this week's models to the problem that I am doing in my assignment. I did not understand how I can apply these models to my assignment. 


**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** A challenge that I encountered was applying certain models to my assignment and how I can use it to solve the problem that my assignment is on. To handle this challenge, all of the members of my group performed individual research about these models and documented all information and decided if we can apply the model to our case study. 


**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** In preparation for next week's lecture, I would make sure that I have no doubts in regards to ast week's content so that I can understand next week's content properly. 


**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** A theory that proved to be useful was Replicator dynamics. This is because it can help us learn how things evolve and how people think. This can be somewhat useful for us to use in our assignment. Our problem for the assignment is Strategies to contain COVID-19. Therefore we can use this to know how people think and how they will behave to a certain situation.
