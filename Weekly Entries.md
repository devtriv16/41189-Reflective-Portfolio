# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio

## Week 1
**What have I learnt this week?**  Week 1 was an introductive week for everyone and mostly everyone was new to the contents of this subject. This week we were introduced to the different types of systems, their functions and their purpose.


**What do I 'now know' that I did not before?** Before Week 1, I had no proper definition of a system and the different types of systems. After the first workshop, I understood what systems are, the difference between the different types of systems and the function of each system.


**What insights have I gained?** The insights I have gained in Week 1 are: - What complicated and complex systems are - Introduction to the new term, Chaos systems - Characteristics of the three types of systems 


**What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?** My strengths include understanding a concept when it is taught rather than leaving it till later to understand it, and the ability to research and gather useful information of the content of this subject. However, one of my weaknesses is that I leave things to the last minute but for the assignments, I will try my best to get it done as soon as possible.


**What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?** Since this was week 1, the teams were not formed yet. Therefore, every student doing this subject was working individually. Challenges that I encountered while studying were finding reliable and accurate information and working on GitHub (since I was completely new to it). One way I handled the first challenge was by researching and visiting multiple websites to check for overlapping information. Some websites produce inaccurate information. Therefore, the websites must be reputable websites and the information must be uploaded by well-known authors. To handle the second challenge, I watched GitHub tutorials on YouTube and the video on Canvas that gives us an introduction to GitHub and how to use it.


**What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?** My approach to next week's workshop would be making notes and noting down valuable information into my notebook. This way, it can help me remember things comfortably. I expect to come across some more abstruse content, but I am hoping to understand it well by noting down important points and asking questions if I don't understand something.


**What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?** Something that proved to be useful from this week was the difference between complicated and complex Systems. People often consider complicated and complex systems to be the same because complicated and complex are synonyms of each other. This includes me as well. I thought that complicated and complex systems are the same but now I have learnt that these two are different from each other.
